# French Translation for algorithmics pseudocode

Small package to help with french translation for pseudocode.

## Context

This package is intended for use alongside Szász János' [algorithmicx](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx "algorithm writing package") package.

The aim of this package is to provide a french translation of terms and words used in algorithms to make it integrate seamlessly in a french written document.

## Use

To use this package, simply import it as usual then use the same commands you would use with algorithmicx.

The packahe will then translate at compilation time the terms of the algorithm to french language.

An example of use is included in file `frpseudocode-example.tex`, along a PDF output of that file.
